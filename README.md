# Face_Recognition_Project

- Created a Face Detection and Recognition Security System that can be used by IITH at the main gate to keep track of students.
- It can serve as a replacement to the current ID card scanning technology that is being used. The current system is easily cheated by students carrying their friend's ID cards or generating a bar code online for their roll number on their phones and scanning their phones.
- The advantage of my system is that it uses the face to identify the person, hence there is no chance of getting cheated. Also, there is no requirement to carry the ID card at all times which can get lost at times.
- My system can also be used to mark student attendance as it allows multiple faces to be recognized at the same time.
